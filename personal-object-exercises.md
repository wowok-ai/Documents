## üèóÔ∏è Understanding Wowok's Account System First

**Important**: Before we start, let's understand how Wowok accounts work:

- **AI generates accounts**: Your AI can create unlimited accounts, each with unique addresses
- **System-managed keys**: Private keys are securely managed by the system - no one can export them
- **Default account**: AI operations use your current default account unless specified otherwise
- **Account isolation**: Each account can only access its own resources
- **Test environment**: New accounts can get test SUI tokens from the faucet for practice

**Try This First**:

```
"Help me understand my current account setup. Show me my default account address and balance, then help me get some test SUI tokens from the faucet so I can practice."
```

## üéØ Level 1: Create Your On-Chain Profile

**The Challenge**: Traditional profiles live in company databases. What if your profile lived on the blockchain where you control it?

**Your Mission**: Create a Personal object with your basic information stored permanently on-chain.

**Try This**:

```
"Help me create my personal profile on Wowok. I want to add my name as 'Alex', set my profession as 'Creative Developer', add my location as 'San Francisco', and include my GitHub profile. Make this information publicly visible."
```

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ You have a Personal object with your information stored on-chain
- ‚úÖ You can query your profile and see the data
- ‚úÖ You understand this data is permanently stored and you control it
- ‚úÖ You see your profile has a unique on-chain address

**Why This Matters**: Your Personal object is:

- **Permanent**: Stored on blockchain, can't be deleted by others
- **Controlled by you**: Only you can update your information
- **Publicly verifiable**: Anyone can see this information belongs to your address
- **Composable**: Other Wowok objects can reference this information

## üéØ Level 2: Build Your Address Network

**The Challenge**: Blockchain addresses are hard to remember. How do you keep track of who's who in your network?

**Your Mission**: Use Personal object's address marking feature to build your social network and organize your contacts.

**Try This**:

```
"Now I want to use my Personal object to organize my network. Help me mark some addresses with names and tags. Add my friend's address 0x1234... with the name 'Sarah - Designer' and tags 'friend' and 'collaborator'. Also mark my cold wallet address with name 'My Cold Wallet' and tag 'secure-funds'. Show me how this creates an organized address book."
```

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ You've marked several addresses with meaningful names
- ‚úÖ You've added tags to categorize different types of relationships
- ‚úÖ You can easily identify addresses in your network
- ‚úÖ You understand how this replaces traditional contact lists

**Pro Tip**: This address marking system becomes incredibly valuable as you interact with more people and services in the Wowok ecosystem!

## üéØ Level 3: Multi-Account Management & Security

**The Challenge**: You might want different accounts for different purposes - one for daily use, one connected to your cold wallet for large transactions.

**Your Mission**: Create a second account and understand how to manage multiple identities and security practices.

**Try This**:

```
"Help me create a second account for managing larger funds. Create a new account called 'Alex-Secure', then show me how to switch between my accounts. I want to understand how I can use my regular account for daily operations but connect a cold wallet for important transactions. Also show me how each account can have its own Personal profile."
```

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ You have multiple accounts with different purposes
- ‚úÖ You understand how to switch between accounts
- ‚úÖ You see how each account can have its own Personal profile
- ‚úÖ You understand the security model: system accounts for convenience, cold wallets for security

**Level Up**: You now understand Wowok's flexible account system! You can have multiple identities, each with their own profiles and purposes, while maintaining security through proper account separation.

## üí° Mini Challenge: Create a Professional Network

**Creative Exercise**: Many professionals have different aspects to their identity. Create a network setup that reflects your professional life.

**Try This**:

```
"Help me create a professional network setup. I want one account for my freelance work, another for my startup project, and I want to mark addresses of my clients, partners, and service providers with appropriate tags. Show me how to organize this so I can easily manage different aspects of my professional life."
```

**Share Your Creation**: Post about your multi-account professional setup and how you're organizing your network!

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

**If account creation fails**:

- Make sure you're on the testnet for practice
- Check that you have sufficient balance for transaction fees
- Try creating with just a name first, then add more information

**If address marking isn't working**:

- Verify the addresses you're marking are valid
- Make sure you're using your own Personal object (can't mark addresses in others' profiles)
- Check that you have the correct permissions

**If you can't switch accounts**:

- Remember that account switching affects all subsequent operations
- Use the account query to verify which account is currently active
- Each account maintains its own Personal profile separately

**Alternative Approaches**:

- **Simpler version**: "Create a basic profile with just name and one social link"
- **Different focus**: "Focus on marking just 2-3 important addresses first"

**Need help?**: The community has great examples of creative Personal profile setups!
