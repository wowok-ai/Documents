# Order Object: Your Transaction Coordinator

> "When customers purchase services, Orders record everything and coordinate the entire transaction lifecycle."

## What You'll Build (30 seconds)

By the end, you will understand Order basics:

- **Basic Order** â€” purchase service and see Order creation
- **Order Management** â€” handle funds and refunds through Service operations

**Prereqs**: You already created Service objects with published offerings. Network is `sui testnet`. Token type is `0x2::sui::SUI`.

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Order objects are automatically created when you purchase services. They handle payments and refunds through Service operations. If you get stuck, ask your AI assistant: "Help me purchase a service to create an Order" or "How do I manage Order refunds?"

**Pre-flight** (copy one line):

```
"On sui testnet, show my default account and SUI balance; if low, guide me to the faucet and wait for funds."
```
