# Order Object: Your Transaction Coordinator

> "When customers purchase services, Orders record everything and coordinate the entire transaction lifecycle."

## Overview

### Definition

A transactional object generated when a Service is purchased, capturing payment records, fulfillment progress, discounts, and both parties' rights and obligations under programmable Guards.

### Functionality

Orders manage the full lifecycle of a transactionâ€”from initial payment and discount application to service fulfillment, dispute resolution, refunds, and withdrawal settlements.
They bind directly to the `Service` and spawn a `Progress` to track real-time delivery. Optional fields like contact info are stored encrypted to preserve user privacy.
Guards govern the logic of how much each party may withdraw or be refunded based on delivery status, contract breaches, or emergencies.

### Use Case â€” Traveler Purchase & Dispute Handling

- Tom books a $5,000 USDT safari via Nature Explorers Travel and enjoys a 10% early bird discount, paying $4,500 USDT.
- The Order tracks his trip from preparation to execution through a linked `Progress`.
- Prior to departure, the provider cancels the trip. The `Refund Guard` ensures Tom automatically receives a full refund.
- During the trip, Tom realizes the accommodation differs from the agreed "luxury tent." A `Breach Reward Guard` triggers, and Tom receives a 5% compensation.
- When Tom becomes ill mid-trip, an `Emergency Refund Guard` is activated. Based on his verified medical certificate, the system grants a proportional refund.

### Key Features

- **Bound Progress instance** â€” Real-time tracking of service delivery stages
- **Guard-based refund & withdrawal logic** â€” Enforce who can claim what portion, under what conditions
- **Discount & pricing transparency** â€” Discounts, adjustments, and final prices are recorded immutably
- **Encrypted buyer information** â€” Optional data like delivery details or ID proof is securely stored
- **Integrated with Arbitration** â€” Supports seamless dispute resolution when paired with Arbitration and Service objects
- **Full audit trail** â€” Payment, refund, and settlement actions are permanently recorded on-chain

Orders act as the atomic unit of economic consensus within WoWok, linking intent, commitment, and accountability into one programmable structure.
