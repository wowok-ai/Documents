# Service Object: Your Digital Business Engine

> "Transform any service into a purchasable, transparent business with automated workflows and built-in customer protection"

## What You'll Build (30 seconds)

You'll create **Service objects** that turn your skills, products, or services into purchasable digital offerings with transparent pricing, automated workflows, and built-in customer protection. Think of them as smart contracts that handle everything from payment processing to service delivery - your complete business-in-a-box on the blockchain.

## üéØ Level 1: Basic Service Offering with Pricing

**The Challenge**: You want to offer a simple service - like tutoring, consulting, or freelance work - with clear pricing and basic customer interaction.

**Your Mission**: Create your first Service object that customers can discover, purchase, and interact with.

**Try This A** (as service provider):

```
"Create my first Service object for freelance writing services with three offerings: 'Blog Post Writing' (50 SUI, 10 stock), 'Website Copy' (100 SUI, 5 stock), 'Technical Documentation' (150 SUI, 3 stock). Set up Permission and Treasury if needed, then publish the Service. Return all addresses and on-chain links."
```

**Try This B** (as buyer):

```
"Now test the Service by placing an order for 'Blog Post Writing'. Show the order process, Treasury balance changes, and what happens when I try to order more than available stock."
```

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ You see Service address, Permission address, Treasury address, and on-chain links
- ‚úÖ Order object is created with address and transaction hash when buyer purchases
- ‚úÖ Treasury balance increases by exact purchase amount (50 SUI for blog post)
- ‚úÖ Stock decreases correctly (Blog Post Writing: 10‚Üí9 after purchase)
- ‚úÖ **Stock management works**: When stock reaches 0, new orders show "inventory insufficient"
- ‚úÖ **Instant monetization**: Skills turned into purchasable offerings immediately
- ‚úÖ **Transparent pricing**: Customers see exact costs upfront
- ‚úÖ **Automated payments**: No manual invoicing needed

## üéØ Level 2: Professional Service with Policies and Portfolio

**The Challenge**: Create a more sophisticated service that includes customer requirements, service policies, and integration with your Repository data for credibility.

**Your Mission**: Build a professional-grade Service that demonstrates advanced features like customer information collection and credential verification.

**Try This A** (as service provider):

```
"Create professional 'Business Strategy Consulting' Service with three tiers: Basic (200 SUI, 20 slots), Premium (500 SUI, 10 slots), Full Audit (1000 SUI, 5 slots). Include customer info requirements and link to my credentials Repository. Return all addresses and links."
```

**Try This B** (as buyer):

```
"Test ordering the Premium package, providing required company information. Show Order creation, Treasury balance change, and how customer requirements are captured."
```

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ You see Service address, Repository address, Order address, and on-chain links
- ‚úÖ Treasury balance increases by 500 SUI (Premium package purchase)
- ‚úÖ Order object contains customer company information as required
- ‚úÖ Service references Repository credentials for enhanced credibility
- ‚úÖ **Customer requirements work**: Orders capture required company details
- ‚úÖ **Credential verification**: Repository data enhances service trustworthiness
- ‚úÖ **Professional pricing**: Higher-value services command appropriate pricing

**Pro Tip**: Professional Services that reference credential Repositories and collect customer requirements convert better and command higher prices!

## üéØ Level 3: Dynamic Service with Automated Workflows

**The Challenge**: Create a sophisticated Service that integrates with Machine objects for automated workflow management, conditional pricing, and complex service delivery.

**Your Mission**: Build a Service that demonstrates the full power of Wowok's automated business logic and workflow integration.

**Try This A** (as service provider):

```
"Create 'Custom Software Development' Service with Machine workflow and Guard protection. Three tiers: Basic (2000 SUI), Complex (5000 SUI), Enterprise (10000 SUI), 3 slots each. Include Refund Guards (7-day full refund) and Breach Guards. Return all addresses and links."
```

**Try This B** (as buyer):

```
"Order the Complex Project (5000 SUI) and show Order creation, Treasury balance change, and Progress object address."
```

**Try This C** (test Guard failures):

```
"Demonstrate Guard failures: try to refund after 7 days (should fail with 'time exceeded'), try to breach claim without valid conditions (should fail with specific Guard field error). Show exact failure messages."
```

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ You see Service, Machine, Order, Progress addresses and on-chain links
- ‚úÖ Treasury balance increases by 5000 SUI (Complex Project purchase)
- ‚úÖ Progress object tracks workflow stages with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Refund Guards work**: 7-day refund succeeds, 8-day refund fails with "time exceeded"
- ‚úÖ **Breach Guards work**: Invalid breach claims fail with specific Guard field errors
- ‚úÖ **Guard failure paths**: You see exact error messages when conditions aren't met
- ‚úÖ **Workflow integration**: Machine coordinates multi-stage automated processes

**Level Up**: You now understand how Services can orchestrate complex, multi-stage business processes with automated verification and customer protection!

## üí° Mini Challenge: Multi-Service Photography Package

**Creative Exercise**: Design a comprehensive photography service ecosystem that demonstrates Service composition and cross-service integration.

**Try This** (as service provider):

```
"Create photography ecosystem with four Services: Portrait (100 SUI, 50 slots), Wedding (2000 SUI, 10 slots), Editing (50 SUI, 100 slots), Equipment Rental (30 SUI/day, 20 items). Show cross-service integration and return all Service addresses, Treasury addresses, and on-chain links."
```

**Share Your Creation**: Post about your photography business ecosystem and how you're using Service objects to create comprehensive offerings!

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

**If Service creation fails**:

- Ensure you created the Permission object first with proper service management rights
- Check that you have a Treasury object set up for receiving payments
- Verify your token type is correct (usually '0x2::sui::SUI' for SUI payments)
- Make sure your account has the necessary permissions in the Permission object

**If Service publishing fails**:

- Check that all required fields are properly configured (sales items, pricing, etc.)
- Verify that any referenced objects (Treasury, Machine, Guard) actually exist
- Ensure withdraw_guard is either properly configured or cleared with removeall
- Make sure you have publishing permissions in the Permission object

**If customers can't order from your Service**:

- Confirm the Service is published and active
- Check that the Service isn't paused
- Verify that items have stock available (stock > 0) - sold out items should show clear "inventory insufficient" messages
- Ensure pricing is set correctly and customers have sufficient funds

**Price precision issues**:

- Remember SUI uses 9 decimal places on-chain - display prices in human-readable format (e.g., "50 SUI") but be aware of precision in calculations
- If you see unexpected pricing behavior, check that price calculations account for SUI's decimal precision

**If payment processing doesn't work**:

- Verify the Treasury object is properly linked to your Service
- Check that the Treasury has the correct token type configuration
- Ensure withdraw guards are properly configured for payment processing
- Confirm that the Service has proper permission to use the Treasury

**Service Management Operations**:

- **Pause/Resume**: "Pause my Service temporarily, then resume it. Show how this affects new orders."
- **Update Stock**: "Add 5 more units to 'Blog Post Writing' stock. Show stock level changes."
- **Alternative Approaches**: "Create a Service that only offers one item with fixed pricing"
